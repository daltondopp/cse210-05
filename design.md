W05 Teach One Another: Designer
	This week we received an assignment to review the snake game. We decided that our design for the prove assignment was going to largely incorporate the same classes that exist in that assignment, but we are going to incorporate polymorphism to create a new player. There will be a player one and 2 and the difference between them will be their scores as they progress through the game. 
A diagram of the layout will roughly look like this:

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- cycle               (source code)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
